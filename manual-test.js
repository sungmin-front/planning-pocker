ðŸŽ¯ Manual Test Steps for Vote Count Fix (Issue #8)
=================================================

1. Open http://localhost:4000 in TWO browser windows/tabs
2. Window 1: Create a room with nickname "Host"
3. Window 2: Join the same room with nickname "Player2"
4. Window 1: Add a story "Test Story"
5. Window 1: Start voting on the story
6. Both windows: Vote (e.g., Host votes 5, Player2 votes 8)
7. Window 1: Click "Reveal Votes"
   
   âœ… Should show: "Votes revealed!" and green progress ring
   
8. Open THIRD browser window/tab
9. Window 3: Join the same room with nickname "Player3"
   
   âœ… BEFORE FIX: Would show amber/yellow progress ring (not 100%)
   âœ… AFTER FIX: Should STILL show green progress ring (100%)
   
10. Window 2: Close the tab (Player2 leaves)
    
    âœ… BEFORE FIX: Would show incorrect progress calculation
    âœ… AFTER FIX: Should STILL show green progress ring (100%)
    
11. Window 1: Click "Restart Voting"
    
    âœ… Should now show current player count for new voting (0/2)

Expected Results:
- During revealed state: Vote completion should remain at 100% (green) regardless of players joining/leaving
- After restart: Should use current player count for new voting session

// You can also check the vote count text in the center of the voting area
// It should maintain the original vote count/total when votes are revealed

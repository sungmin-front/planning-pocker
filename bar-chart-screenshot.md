# Bar Chart Implementation Screenshot

![Bar Chart Statistics Modal](https://github.com/sungmin-front/planning-pocker/raw/feature/bar-chart-statistics/bar-chart-statistics.png)

The statistics modal now displays a bar chart instead of a line chart, showing:
- Vote distribution across all options (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ?, â˜•)
- Clear visualization of vote counts with blue bars
- Proper styling with rounded corners and responsive design
- Statistics cards showing highest, lowest, and average values

This resolves GitHub issue #7 by changing from LineChart to BarChart in the VotingResultsModal component.
